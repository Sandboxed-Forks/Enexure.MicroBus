#Contributing Guidelines

 - Try to follow the coding style already in place.
 - Please do TDD and write unit- or integration- tests before adding new features.
 - Ensure that existing unit tests pass after you make a change.
 - Don't break backward compatibility.
 - If possible, stick to small changes that are easily verified and approved.
 - If you want to make large changes, first please open an issue describe the problem and your design/plan for the proposed solution. If we all agree then you can move forward with that change.
 - Don't commit directly to the repo. Always fork, make your changes, submit a pull request then have someone else approve your changes.

 

I'm also looking for the person who originally wrote these Guidelines. First seen on twitter but I forgot to copy the Author.
